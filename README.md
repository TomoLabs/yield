                                        TomoYieldHook

TomoYieldHook converts Uniswap v4 swap fees into auto-compounding restaking yield by routing earned fees directly into Liquid Restaking Token (LRT) protocols via a programmable Uniswap v4 Hook and a modular YieldRouterLRT adapter. It functions as a fully autonomous, non-custodial yield engine that turns DEX trading volume into passive EigenLayer restaking rewards.

   OVERVIEW

TomoYieldHook is a mainnet-live Uniswap v4 Hook that captures swap fees at the protocol level and reinvests them into EigenLayer LRTs to generate autonomous, compounding yield. This transforms Uniswap liquidity and trading activity into a programmable yield stream that DAOs, LPs, FeeSplitters, and creator economies can route, split, or automate.

End-to-end yield automation — including fee capture, LRT deposit, share accounting, yield harvesting, and distribution — is implemented entirely on-chain and validated across local, testnet, and Ethereum mainnet environments.
